# cyrillic-character-decoder
This is a take-home technical assessment given when applying for a Software Engineering
position at Ag Leader Technology. Being that this is done on your own time if you have any
questions use your best judgement rather than ask and wait for a reply. Note that our review of
this will be assuming this is professional work.

# Problem
Write an application that, when given an arbitrary sequence of alphanumeric characters as
input, will convert each character to some cyrillic character and provide a decoding table as part
of the output. Each unique character should be converted to a different cyrillic character. There
should be some way for an user to enter in the random sequence of characters for conversion.
As an example, if the user input the string “aabcdDef6” a potential output string could be
“ДДѮПРФВЛЂ” with the decoding table indicating a=Д, b=Ѯ, c=П, d=Р, D=Ф, e=В, f=Л, 6=Ђ.
